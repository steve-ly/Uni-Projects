# University Projects
Here lies the major projects I have worked on during my time in University

### project-backend-master
Source code for SoftEng Fundamentals course for flask backend development in python. This was a group project and my contributions include:
- Writing blackbox tests for authentication functions, handle generation function, Adminstration functions
- Writing most of the HTTP testing for all other functions
- Developing the authentication functionality including handle generation, adminstration functions, generating tokens and session ids, hashing data, unwrapping tokens,
- Helped with a majority of bug fixes and pylint/coverage issues

### snake
Source code for a mips project for Comp systems fundamentals, simulates the classice snake game using mips.

### ugv-code
Source code for a mechatronics project to develop a complete software package to control the Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) using C++ with .NET frameworks. Modules included:
- Authentication for remote connection
- Laser
- GNSS
- Motion Control
- Camera
Additionally, created visual representation using opengl, of the lidar as well as display location and heading of the robot and its gps location.

### Autonomous Systems
Solution to problems in Autonomous Systems simulated data in Matlab
P1 implementing data processing and extraction for simulated data of a UGV:
-  Adds deckreckoning function
-  Process LiDar scan
-  Estimation of positions of Objects of interests
P2 Continues of p2:
- Adds EKF localization
- Adds estimation of ugv pose and gyroscope bias

### Thesis
For my group project thesis, We had to develop a weight measuring system within a dialysis chair. For my part I :
- Create and designed the code that runs on the arduino
- Made a rudimentary prototype to test software on, made from an arduino uno, SparkFun Qwiic Scale, load cell and some scrap electronics and parts for the load cell base.

- Helped with assimalating the electrical components and software for the final design
- Troubleshooting and testing of the final product
