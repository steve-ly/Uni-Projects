1) Make sure that the all the required dependencies match requirements.txt
2) Compile the phase_d controller using webots and make sure that the phase_d controller is selected
3) Run phaseD_driver.py using your python terminal using python ./phaseD_driver.py
4) Close the figure pop ups when ready to look at the net figure and continue with the program

Notes:
The console outputs are currently being outputed to the python terminal to allow webots to automatically close,
if you want to outputs to be shown on webots, swap to the other subprocess in phaseD_driver.py on line 51.
If you choose to do this, webots and the python program will no longer automatically close.

If you want to test with another world, make sure to set the controller in the new world before running the python script.

Phase D has only been tested on Windows and should only be ran on windows machine to prevent any potential issues.
